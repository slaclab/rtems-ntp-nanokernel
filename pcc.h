/* There are two methods for implementing nanosecond

 *
 * A) the timer responsible for generating system clock
 *    interrupts itself is readable with a high resolution and
 *    its value at the time of interrupt generation is known.
 *    This is the preferred method.
 *
 * B) system clock ISR reads a PCC ("processor cycle counter")
 *    which is possibly asynchronous to the system clock.
 *    At each interrupt, the ISR saves the PCC to a global variable.
 *    It is essential to minimize jitter of this reading with
 *    respect to interrupt time. Therefore, reading PCC should
 *    be performed ASAP in the clock ISR.
 *
 * Then there is method C) which means that there is no
 * high resolution clock support at all. The kernel clock
 * just has a 'tick'-level resolution but is nevertheless
 * synchronized to NTP.
